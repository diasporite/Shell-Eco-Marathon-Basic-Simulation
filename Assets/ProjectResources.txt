NOTES
- Velocity based model (rb.velocity = ...) seems better than force based model (rb.AddForce())
- Assumptions
  - Vehicle moves in 2D plane (if lift not enabled)
  - No slip on wheels
  - All mass of components are uniform
  - Wheels steer at equal angular rates (allows front wheels to be modelled as one wheel)
